            <p>Everyone loves inspirational quotes about butterflies. You know... 
                the caterpilliar transforming and flying to a better place. But have you ever concidered that
                maybe life is more like being a frog? That that expodential growth
                doesn't happen in the saftey of cacoon, but rather growth happens 
                as life happens, and as time goes on, you go from swimming, to developing 
                little legs, until finally you can hop out of the water onto land to 
                explore the wider world. Only to eventually be eaten by a bird, or a cat.
                The end.
